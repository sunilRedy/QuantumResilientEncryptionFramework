2. **Quantum Entanglement-Based Secure Communication**  
   Leverages quantum entanglement and simulated QKD protocols for secure message exchange.

3. **Self-Healing Encryption Protocols**  
   Automatically detects and repairs compromised encryption layers.

4. **Quantum-Resistant Data Integrity Verification**  
   Ensures tamper-proof data with quantum-safe hashing algorithms.

5. **Quantum-Resilient Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**  
   Combines biometric and post-quantum cryptographic techniques for secure user authentication.

6. **Quantum-Resilient Secure Data Sharing Protocol**  
   Safeguards sensitive data sharing across distributed systems.

7. **Quantum-Resilient Blockchain Integration for Data Integrity**  
   Integrates blockchain technology with quantum-resistant digital signatures.

8. **Quantum-Resilient Privacy-Preserving Data Collaboration**  
   Implements lattice-based encryption to ensure collaborative data security.

9. **Quantum-Resilient Digital Signature System**
